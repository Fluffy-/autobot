# autobot

A C# project to: <br>
• Digitally represent live engine data as on-screen Instrument Cluster<br>
• Replace all dash & door controls with on-screen controls (touch screen) <br>
<br>
This C# program will be run on a touch screen computer inside the car. <br>
Top half of the screen will be for instrument display, the other half for controls. <br>
<br>
The car will be interfaced with an Arduino (or similar device) for communication. <br>
Currently, this program uses a SQL server to control the car from the internet.
<br>
Without an Arduino Connected, or a SQL connection, there may be errors and/or the <br>
program will not be usable.<br>
